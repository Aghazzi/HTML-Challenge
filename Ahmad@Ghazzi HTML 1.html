            <p>
                Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun.<br>
                Studies have shown that playing video games regularly may increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity.<br>

                * Gray matter is associated with msucle control.<br>
                * Memories. <br>

                The stereotype of a shy person who uses video games as a way to escape is not what the average gamer looks like.<br>
                Past research involving children found that those who played more video games were more likely to have good social skills, perform better academically.<br>
                Plus to have built better relationships with other students because of the social and collaborative component to some types of games.

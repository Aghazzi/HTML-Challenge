                Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun.<br>
                Studies have shown that playing video games regularly may increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity.<br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Gray matter is associated with msucle control.</li>

                <u>Gamers may have better social skills</u>.<br><br>
                The stereotype of a shy person who uses video games as a way to escape is not what the average gamer looks like.<br>
                Past research involving children found that those who played more video games were more likely to have good social skills, perform better academically.<br>
                Plus to have built better relationships with other students because of the social and collaborative component to some types of games.

                Although video game genres were once fairly clear cut, that's simply not the case these days.
                There's a growing variety of genres and sub-genres to understand, especially as game developers mix and blend different types of games in new and unexpected ways.<br>
                That means the video-gaming landscape is constantly evolving. Studios work on tight schedules and follow trends when the opportunity arises.<br>
